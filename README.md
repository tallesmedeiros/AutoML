Abstract = _"In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the way in which we consume and analyse sports. The role of AI in improving decision-making and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and in sport research. Finally, we present some hypothetical scenarios of how AI and ML could shape the future of sports."_

Abstract = _"The sports domain presents a number of significant computational challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In this paper, we explore the techniques that have been applied to the challenges within team sports thus far. We focus on a number of different areas, namely match outcome prediction, tactical decision making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction. By assessing the work in these areas, we explore how AI is used to predict match outcomes and to help sports teams improve their strategic and tactical decision making. In particular, we describe the main directions in which research efforts have been focused to date. This highlights not only a number of strengths but also weaknesses of the models and techniques that have been employed. Finally, we discuss the research questions that exist in order to further the use of AI and ML in team sports."_

Abstract = _"Until recently tactical analysis in elite soccer were based on observational data using variables which discard most contextual information. Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon."_

Abstract = _"Basketball is among the most popular sports in the world, and its related industries have also produced huge economic benefits. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in basketball has attracted a large amount of attention. We conducted a comprehensive review of the application research of AI in basketball through literature retrieval. Current research focuses on the AI analysis of basketball team and player performance, prediction of competition results, analysis and prediction of shooting, AI coaching system, intelligent training machine and arena, and sports injury prevention. Most studies have shown that AI technology can improve the training level of basketball players, help coaches formulate suitable game strategies, prevent sports injuries, and improve the enjoyment of games. At the same time, it is also found that the number and level of published papers are relatively limited. We believe that the application of AI in basketball is still in its infancy. We call on relevant industries to increase their research investment in this area, and promote the improvement of the level of basketball, making the game increasingly exciting as its worldwide popularity continues to increase.

Abstract = _"Optimizing athlete’s performance is one of the most important and challenging aspects of coaching. Physiological and positional data, often acquired using wearable devices, have been useful to identify patterns, thus leading to a better understanding of the game and, consequently, providing the opportunity to improve the athletic performance. Even though there is a panoply of research in pattern recognition, there is a gap when it comes to non-controlled environments, as during sports training and competition. This research paper combines the use of physiological and positional data as sequential features of different artificial intelligence approaches for action recognition in a real match context, adopting futsal as its case study. The traditional artificial neural networks (ANN) is compared with a deep learning method, Long Short-Term Memory Network, and also with the Dynamic Bayesian Mixture Model, which is an ensemble classification method. The methods were used to process all data sequences, which allowed to determine, based on the balance between precision and recall, that Dynamic Bayesian Mixture Model presents a superior performance, with an F1 score of 80.54% against the 33.31% achieved by the Long Short-Term Memory Network and 14.74% achieved by ANN."_

Abstract = _"Wearable technologies are small electronic and mobile devices with wireless communication capabilities that can be worn on the body as a part of devices, accessories or clothes. Sensors incorporated within wearable devices enable the collection of a broad spectrum of data that can be processed and analysed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this narrative review, we performed a literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. We included any original studies that used sensors to collect data for a sporting event and subsequently used an AI-based system to process the data with diagnostic, treatment or monitoring intents. The included studies show the use of AI in various sports including basketball, baseball and motor racing to improve athletic performance. We classified the studies according to the stage of an event, including pre-event training to guide performance and predict the possibility of injuries; during events to optimise performance and inform strategies; and in diagnosing injuries after an event. Based on the included studies, AI techniques to process data from sensors can detect patterns in physiological variables as well as positional and kinematic data to inform how athletes can improve their performance. Although AI has promising applications in sports medicine, there are several challenges that can hinder their adoption. We have also identified avenues for future work that can provide solutions to overcome these challenges."_

Abstract = _"Injuries are common in sports and can have significant physical, psychological and financial consequences. Machine learning (ML) methods could be used to improve injury prediction and allow proper approaches to injury prevention. The aim of our study was therefore to perform a systematic review of ML methods in sport injury prediction and prevention."_
